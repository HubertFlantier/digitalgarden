## Technique Acquisition (60 min)

1. [ ] Defensive Technique (30 min)
2. [ ] Offensive Technique (30 min)

### Explain/Understand

Either

	1. be sure to fully understand the technique and it's parts
2. ... if s/o prepared a technique ("Ganz-Teil-Ganz"-Methode)
	1. demonstrate whole technique
	2. explain & demonstrate individual parts
	3. demonstrate whole technique again

### Drill

- drill **slow** and **precise**
- comment on each part of the sequence as if we're **reciting a lesson**
- *"Slow is smooth and smooth is fast."*

## [Position Game](https://www.bjjflowcharts.com/blogs/academy/train-like-the-death-squad), Specific Training (~6 min per Position)

=> Remember the techniques that were just drilled. Let partner use these techniques, with increasing resistence. <=

1. [ ] ==Mount== until …
	- bottom player gets back to closed/open guard
	- bottom player ends on top
	- submission occurs
2. [ ] ==Turtle== until …
	- see Mount
3. [ ] ==Single Leg on the Mat== until …
